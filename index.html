            This website will be continually updated as I learn new skills, and may even 
            be refactored and rebuilt as I continue learning Angular, React, and jQuery.

        <p>A special thank you to github user <code>dhg</code> for his excellent CSS framework skeleton.css! 
            It's a fantastic, minimalist (my favorite) framework that is just so beautiful and clean.
            If you like what you see here, I definitely recommend giving it a whirl on your own site either at <a href="https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton">SkeletonCSS</a> 
            or 
            <a href="https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton/releases/download/2.0.4/Skeleton-2.0.4.zip" class="button button-primary">Download direct!</a>
            <p>Either way, show them some love on their github user page!</p>
