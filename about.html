            <p>
                My name is Joshua Wilson. I'm currently a student of several courses on Udemy.
                All of which pertain to software and web development in some form or another.
                Among them: Data science with python, C++ through game development, Angular, React, JS, etc.
                I also use Skillshare to expand my learning outside of these sources, and I always embrace new avenues of 
                research and education. This world is meant to be understood, technology makes that a reality.
            </p>
